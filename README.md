    <p>This project is based on most important concepts of programming i.e Data DATA-STRUCTURES. The project
        is text editor in python which uses all concepts of DAta DATA-STRUCTURES such as Linked list, Stack, 
        Queues etc. This project also features an important Graphical user interface extension of python i.e
        Tkinter. The whole interface is designed on Tkinter. The program takes input as string or file and
        edit it as by word or character and data sturcutre of users choice. After this project I learned a lot
        about python programming, implementing Linked list, Stack, Queues etc.
